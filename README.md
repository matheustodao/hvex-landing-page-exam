# 🎯 Goal

The test consists of verifying your knowledge in frontend and your analytical thinking when developing. We know that each developer has their own particularities, tools, plugins, and technologies that they like.

<br />
<br />

# 👀 What you will find in the project

The purpose-built project has all the requirements and optional features described in the challenge. It was also developed to apply all my knowledge and learn something new during the development process. Therefore, you will find **clean code, clean architecture, the application running in a Docker container, conventional commits, a mobile-first approach, a responsive app, and high Lighthouse scores, Vercel, Continuous integration and Continuous deployment using Github Actions..**

<br />
<br />

# 🚀 How to run app

To use the application, there are two options: run the project locally or view it in production.
<br/>
<br/>

``If you intend to use Lighthouse to view website scores, it is recommended to use a private browsing tab.``

<br/>

## Production
>[https://hvex-landing-page-exam.vercel.app](https://hvex-landing-page-exam.vercel.app)

<br />
<br />

## 🐋 Locally with Docker

1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheustodao/hvex-landing-page-exam.git
```

2. If it's your first time running the application

```bash
yarn docker:start-build

# OR

npm run docker:start-build
```

3. If it's not your first time, and you already have a Docker container built, then

```bash
yarn docker:start

# OR

npm run docker:start
```

4. Then, you can view the application running on

> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

<br />
<br />

## 🍀 Locally without Docker

---

1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheustodao/hvex-landing-page-exam.git
```

2. Build the application

```bash
yarn build

# OR

npm run build
```

3. Then, start the application

```bash
yarn start

# OR

npm start
```

4. Then, you can view the application running on

> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
